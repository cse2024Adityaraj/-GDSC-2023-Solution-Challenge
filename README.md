 Goal 3 of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is "Good Health and Well-being." This goal aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all people of all ages.

The specific targets of this goal include reducing maternal mortality, ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under five years of age, combating infectious diseases, reducing non-communicable diseases, achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, and strengthening the capacity of countries to respond to health emergencies.

To achieve this goal, various measures can be taken, including increasing investment in healthcare infrastructure, improving access to essential medicines, ensuring access to safe and nutritious food, promoting healthy lifestyles, strengthening healthcare systems, and increasing awareness of health issues.

Good health and well-being are essential for sustainable development, and achieving this goal can have a significant impact on reducing poverty and promoting economic growth.
